# virtual-factorio

This library emulates [Factorio](http://factorio.com) combinators. If you don't know what Factorio is or never use combinators, you don't need it.

The aim of this library is precise and predictable emulation. Any device built with VF should behave exactly like its Factorio analogue. Please report any schemas that don't.

Currently some original features (like 5%) are not implemented. See [issues](https://github.com/m1kc/virtual-factorio/issues).

For usage, see tests and examples in this repo.
